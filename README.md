# 🏦 Fraud Investigation Copilot (LangChain + FastAPI)

An AI-powered **fraud investigation copilot** that explains **why** a transaction was flagged, using:

- 📜 **Policy rules** (RAG over rule documents)
- 📊 **Historical fraud cases** (from `creditcard.csv`)
- 🌐 A **FastAPI REST API** (`/explain`) that returns structured JSON

This is not just a chatbot – it’s a **backend AI service** designed for fraud analysts, risk teams, and audit use cases.

Policy Ingestion

Read .txt policy files from data/policies/

Split into chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

Embed using OpenAIEmbeddings

Store in a Chroma vector store (vectorstore/policies)

Fraud Case Ingestion

Load creditcard.csv from data/credit/

Filter Class == 1 (confirmed fraud)

Convert each row into a short text summary

Embed and store in another Chroma vector store (vectorstore/fraud_cases)

Inference Flow (POST /explain)

Receive transaction JSON

Use policy RAG to determine which rules apply and generate explanation

Use fraud-case retriever to find similar historical frauds

Extract rule IDs (e.g. AML-TRX-001) using regex

Return structured JSON with decision + explanation + rules + similar cases
